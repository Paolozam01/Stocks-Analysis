# Stocks-Analysis written analysis

## Overview of the project:

The whole porpuse of this project was to help Steve analyze data from renewable energy stocks for his parents. There is a lot of available data about this stocks but it is hard to understand it, even for people who study the subject. Steve parents invested money on a stock which they did not know anything about, so first we analyze the data from that stock in order to help them make better decisions with their investments. After this analysis, I was asked to analyze data from different stocks from this industry in order to find the best alternative for Steve parents to invest. The other poropose of creating this code on VBA was to learn how to apply all the tools that I saw in class and also to practice how to simplifly code in order for it to run faster. Practicing and creating projects like this is the best way to learn new skills and it is not different in the case of VBA. Thanks to this I feel more confortable working with this application and I could see myself using it again successfuly. 

## Results:

After running the code, we can very quickly identifiy how renewable energy stocks performed during the year 2017. Results where very positive as we can see on the following image:

But when we run the code on the year 2018, its a very different story. Almost all stocks had negative results during this year. It is very easy to identify the stocks that had good performances because of the formating as we can see on the following image:
