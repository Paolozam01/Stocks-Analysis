# Stocks-Analysis written analysis

##Overview of the project:

The whole porpuse of this project was to help Steve analyze data from renewable energy stocks for his parents. There is a lot of available data about this stocks but it is hard to understand it, even for people who study the subject. Steve parents invested money on a stock which they did not know anything about, so first we analyze the data from that stock in order to help them make better decisions with their investments. After this analysis, I was asked to analyze data from different stocks from this industry in order to find the best alternative for Steve parents to invest. The other poropose of creating this code on VBA was to learn how to apply all the tools that I saw in class. Practicing and creating projects like this is the best way to learn new skills and it is not different in the case of VBA. Thanks to this I feel more confortable working with this application and I could see myself using it again successfuly.
