# Stocks-Analysis written analysis

## Overview of the project:

The whole porpuse of this project was to help Steve analyze data from renewable energy stocks for his parents. There is a lot of available data about this stocks but it is hard to understand it, even for people who study the subject. Steve parents invested money on a stock which they did not know anything about, so first we analyze the data from that stock in order to help them make better decisions with their investments. After this analysis, I was asked to analyze data from different stocks from this industry in order to find the best alternative for Steve parents to invest. The other poropose of creating this code on VBA was to learn how to apply all the tools that I saw in class and also to practice how to simplifly code in order for it to run faster. Practicing and creating projects like this is the best way to learn new skills and it is not different in the case of VBA. Thanks to this I feel more confortable working with this application and I could see myself using it again successfuly. 

## Results:

After running the code, we can very quickly identifiy how renewable energy stocks performed during the year 2017. Results where very positive as we can see on the following image:

But when we run the code on the year 2018, its a very different story. Almost all stocks had negative results during this year. It is very easy to identify the stocks that had good performances because of the formating as we can see on the following image:

We can clearly see that the stock in which Steve parents invested had great results on 2017 but really bead results on 2018. Although the stock dropped 62% Steve parents still had a 138% profit if they invested at the beginning of the 2017. This type of up and downs are normal on almost all industries, and usually when stocks fall like this they rise in the future so I wouldn't say that it would be a bad idea to hold their investment on the DQ stock. On the other hand, we can see that there are two stocks that had positive results on both 2017 and 2018. It might be a good idea to invest in those stocks since it might mean that both of those companies have good products and administration. 

Now talking about the code itself, after refactoring the code the program ran faster than before. Using loops in a more simplified way I was able to deleat some code that was not necessary. I followed the instructions on canvas and I had to figure out how to program the loop correctly. Firts I created an array with all of the stocks inside. I set the ticker index to 0 and created a loop to set some varaibles as long and singels and set the variables to 0 as well. After that I reused the code that I had previously used in order to make loops that would increase the value of the variables in order to get the results of the stocks. After that I used the same formatting code which was helpful in order to identifiy which stocks where successful on both years easily. It was intresting to apply all of my knowledge on this tool in order to make my code run faster. 

The time in which the code ran was the following:
